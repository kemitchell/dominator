# DOMinator

DOMinator is a jQuery-like DOM micro library. DOMinator is not meant to be fully compatible with jQuery, but to only provide a commonly used subset of functionality. DOMinator only works in modern browsers, including IE10+. DOMinator's lack of features has one significant benefit - its tiny size. Compare DOMinator's 1.3kb gzipped footprint to jQuery's 30+kb.
